## Origami + Quartz Composer Demo

List view and detail view interaction animation. I am using Origami and Quartz composer for the Mac. 

It is extremely simple to interchange interaction and animation types. In this test demo I change from a scale+fade to a slide out, no compiling or rendering, it simply works. This is a great way to quickly prototype interactions for development into actual products.

####Snippet from Medium post by Christoph Wolfe on Origami:

> Facebook Origami is basically a lot of additional patches for Quartz composer that make it easier than ever to quickly create a high fidelity mockup of interactions and animations. The best way to understand Quartz composer is more as a visual programming tool with inputs and outputs than a designing software like sketch, photoshop etc.
